          I have always been interested in computers and the software side of
          their inner-workings. So, when covid-19 came around and I needed to
          find a hobby, it was natural for me to jump straight into coding. I
          had chosen <span className="text-offWhite font-mono">Python</span> as
          my starting point, but just a few months later, the perfect
          opportunity came up for me to take up web development, as a couple of
          my close friends needed a website for their startup caf√©. Fast-forward

          <span className="text-offWhite font-mono">
            Node.js, Deno, React, Next.js,
          </span>{" "}
          and even <span className="text-offWhite font-mono">Flutter</span>
